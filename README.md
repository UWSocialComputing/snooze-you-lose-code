# Snooze You Lose

Hello! We're Annika Epperly, Basia Radka, and Karen Velderrain-Lopez and this is our protoype app for CSE 481P at UW.

Snooze You Lose was developed using Android Studio and Firebase.

## Running the App
Our app can be run by cloning this repo and using Android Studio's emulator tool.

### Installing Android Studio
Follow this tutorial to install and get started with Android Studio if you do not already have it set up:

### Downloading the project
Fork and clone your own copy of this repository. Then, load Android Studio and select "Get From VCS".
Paste the HTTPS or SSH code for the repo and add it to your default Android Studio projects folder.

### Adding a new device
Follow the instructions at this link to add a new emulator device (We recommend a Pixel 6 API 33 device):

### Running the app
Once you have your device set up, build the project and run the code on your device.
As a tip for running the emulator, you will want to go into the device's settings
and enable notification permissions for the app. It can also be helpful
to disable some unused apps in order to speed up the emulator.
